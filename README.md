This app is a data visualisation tool for a set of data from google sheet, gte getting data and display them, no user input except for logging in. 

Tools I'll be using: 

UI: React, Material-UI, DevExtreme Reactive, Chart.js, recharts.js <br/>
Routing: React Router
State Managemet: Context API, Redux <br/>
Back-end: Express server <br/>
Authentication: OAuth, JWT <br/>
Data source: Some Google Sheets <br/>
API: Google Sheets API <br/>
Deployment (front-end): Netlify CMS <br/>
Deployment: (back-end): Azure <br/>

Note: 
This repo is archived because I realised I need authentication and authorisation to access private google sheet api, which requies me to keep all the credentials away from the front-end. This means I need to restructure my project repository and it's a better idea to just setup a new repo for this project.
